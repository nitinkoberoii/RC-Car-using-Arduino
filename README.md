# RC-Car-using-Arduino
Robot Car using Arduino controlled via Bluetooth Mobile App.
HI, This is README, & this repository has been created to contain all the files required to make
the Robot Car using Arduino Uno R3 controlled via Bluetooth Android Application.
This was my Digital Logic Design course Project for 2nd year B.Tech Engineering.

The Project is inspired from the video provided on the YouTube by MakeDIY.
